### 1. About The Project
There are many great SNS available on Web, however, We didn't find one that really suit my needs so We create this enhanced one. We want to create a Website so amazing that it will be the last one you ever need -- We think this it itðŸ˜Š

Here is why we create it :
  - To make a website where anyone can write down their goals

How does it work?
  - There are four levels of trees in Bloom.
  - You work towards a goal, and post on Bloom.
  - Flowers bloom according to the number of posts.

Of course, no one SNS will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So We will be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
